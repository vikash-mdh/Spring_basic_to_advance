//        File Handling in Java for Interview Purposes
//        File handling in Java is a crucial topic for interviews, as it deals with reading from and writing to
//        files, handling exceptions, and working with streams. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of file handling concepts and
//        commonly asked questions.

//        1. File Handling Basics in Java
//        In Java, file handling is done using the java.io package. Java provides various classes to handle file
//        operations, such as File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileInputStream,
//        FileOutputStream, etc.

//        Key Classes for File Handling in Java:

//                File: Represents a file or directory.
//                FileInputStream: Reads bytes from a file.
//                FileOutputStream: Writes bytes to a file.
//                FileReader: Reads characters from a file.
//                FileWriter: Writes characters to a file.
//                BufferedReader: Reads text from a character-based input stream.
//                BufferedWriter: Writes text to a character-based output stream.
